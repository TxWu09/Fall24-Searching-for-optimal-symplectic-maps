This work explores symplectic maps that facilitate optimal embeddings within phase spaces. Through the parametrization of an extensive class of symplectic transformations via elementary functions, the embedding challenge is articulated as an optimization problem encapsulated by a loss function. This approach adheres to the principles of symplectic geometry while leveraging variational methods to seek solutions that minimize the defined loss. The methodology offers a framework for achieving optimal embeddings in symplectic contexts.
